                summary: "The business-to-business (B2B) landscape in the United States is undergoing its most significant transformation in a generation. The old playbook is rapidly becoming obsolete, driven by demographic shifts, technological acceleration, and altered buyer expectations. Success now hinges on providing the most seamless, trustworthy, and efficient digital experience.",
                fullText: "Four core themes underpin this new reality. First is The Great Generational Handover, a seismic demographic shift where Millennials and Gen Z now constitute the overwhelming majority of B2B buyers. Second, this handover has fueled The Consumerization of B2B, where buyers bring the expectations of consumer giants like Amazon and Netflix to their professional purchasing. Third, in an environment saturated with information, trust has emerged as the most valuable currency, leading to The Trust Economy. Finally, these forces create The Digital-First, Human-Centric Paradox. While buyers overwhelmingly demand digital self-service, they have not abandoned the need for human connection, especially for expert guidance at critical decision points."
